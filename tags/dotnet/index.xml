For example:
Using tabs/spaces and different sizes of indentation, making your code harder to read; Using different encoding between files, causing hard to find bugs at runtime (showing invalid characters) and breaking automated tests. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to maintain a standard for everyone who works in the code, no matter the editor used, and in a next post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to enforce these (and other) rules on build and in the continuous integration pipeline.</description></item><item><title>Integration tests without API dependencies with ASP.NET Core and WireMock.Net</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 08:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Integration tests without API dependencies with ASP.NET Core and WireMock.Net" />Introduction Although there are many definitions about the scope of an integration test, Martin Fowler defines Narrow integration tests, where the integration with other systems are tested using mocks, and Broad integration tests, where they communicate using real APIs.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to create mocks for HTTP APIs in narrow integration tests using the WireMock.Net library.
What should we mock? Vladimir Khorikov has a concept of managed dependencies and unmanaged dependencies, which I consider complementary to Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s, to choose what should be to mocked.</description></item></channel></rss>
