It helps in finding bugs and requirements not fulfilled at development time, but also decreases the cost of maintenance by making the future changes to our code safer. Besides, the act of writing testable code alone increases the quality of the code we are writing because testable code has to be decoupled.</description></item><item><title>Enforcing .NET code style rules at compile time</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/enforcing-.net-code-style-rules-at-compile-time/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 08:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/enforcing-.net-code-style-rules-at-compile-time/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/enforcing-.net-code-style-rules-at-compile-time/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Enforcing .NET code style rules at compile time" />Introduction Static code analysis is a great tool for spotting some kinds of error in your code, for example, not disposing of objects that implement IDisposable. Also, it helps to enforce and validate if the code written is following a defined standard, for example, using PascalCase for class names and camelCase for parameter names.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Roslyn Analyzers with C# to enforce some standards of code quality and code style on your code, throwing errors at compile time if any rules are not being respected and not allowing the code to be pushed to protected branches of the repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
