In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to create a custom container image that waits for SQL Server startup and runs a pre-configured script. In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use this custom image to run SQL Server in Testcontainers.</description><postDescription>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to configure it to emulate S3 buckets and how to interact with those buckets from a C# application.</description><postDescription>

Even developers who use another main IDE probably use VS Code for some part of their jobs.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show some of the extensions that I use to work, study and write this blog.</description><postDescription>
