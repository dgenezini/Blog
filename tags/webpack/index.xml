This helps those who want to slowly migrate JavaScript applications to Blazor, but unfortunately, won&amp;rsquo;t work for exposing Blazor components as microfrontends, as it works only for JavaScript applications deployed together with the Blazor application.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll present a nuget package that I&amp;rsquo;ve created as a prototype to try to solve this problem, exposing Blazor components with module federation for other applications to consume.</description><postDescription>
