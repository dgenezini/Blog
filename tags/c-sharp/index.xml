In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to create mocks for HTTP APIs in narrow integration tests using the WireMock.Net library.
What should we mock? Vladimir Khorikov has a concept of managed dependencies and unmanaged dependencies, which I consider complementary to Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s, to choose what should be to mocked.</description></item></channel></rss>
