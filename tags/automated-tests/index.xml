It helps in finding bugs and requirements not fulfilled at development time, but also decreases the cost of maintenance by making the future changes to our code safer. Besides, the act of writing testable code alone increases the quality of the code we are writing because testable code has to be decoupled.</description></item><item><title>Integration tests without API dependencies with ASP.NET Core and WireMock.Net</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 08:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Integration tests without API dependencies with ASP.NET Core and WireMock.Net" />Introduction Although there are many definitions about the scope of an integration test, Martin Fowler defines Narrow integration tests, where the integration with other systems are tested using mocks, and Broad integration tests, where they communicate using real APIs.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to create mocks for HTTP APIs in narrow integration tests using the WireMock.Net library.
What should we mock? Vladimir Khorikov has a concept of managed dependencies and unmanaged dependencies, which I consider complementary to Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s, to choose what should be to mocked.</description></item></channel></rss>
