In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to spin up disposable database containers to use in integration tests.</description><postDescription>

This will leave metrics and logs of a successful request when the client received a time-out error.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to solve this problem with cancellation tokens and time-outs.</description><postDescription>

It helps in finding bugs and requirements not fulfilled at development time, but also decreases the cost of maintenance by making the future changes to our code safer. Besides, the act of writing testable code alone increases the quality of the code we are writing because testable code has to be decoupled.
In this last post of this series, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to analyze and enforce a minimum code coverage in our applications, and how to use integration tests to increase our testing surface.</description><postDescription>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to create mocks for HTTP APIs in narrow integration tests using the WireMock.Net library.</description><postDescription>
