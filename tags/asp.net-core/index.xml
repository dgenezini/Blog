The main cost is the added complexity of a SPA framework like Angular or Vue.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use ASP.NET and HTMX to build single-page applications without using JavaScript and SPA frameworks.</description><postDescription>

This will leave metrics and logs of a successful request when the client received a time-out error.

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Cancellation Tokens to cancel running requests that were aborted by clients.</description><postDescription>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to create mocks for HTTP APIs in narrow integration tests using the WireMock.Net library.</description><postDescription>
