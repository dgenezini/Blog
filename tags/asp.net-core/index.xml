This will leave metrics and logs of a successful request when the client received a time-out error.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to solve this problem with cancellation tokens and time-outs.
The solution The idea is to time-out the request in the ASP.</description><postDescription>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Cancellation Tokens to cancel running requests that were aborted by clients.
Cancelation Tokens I&amp;rsquo;ll not explain how Cancelation Tokens work in this post. I recommend reading this great post by Mitesh Shah that explains how they work in a simple way.</description><postDescription>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to create mocks for HTTP APIs in narrow integration tests using the WireMock.Net library.
What should we mock? Vladimir Khorikov has a concept of managed dependencies and unmanaged dependencies, which I consider complementary to Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s, to choose what should be to mocked.</description><postDescription>
