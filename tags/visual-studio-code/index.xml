It allows us to install extentions that can do basicaly anything and improve our productivity and workflow.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll increase the list of extensions from my previous post and show more 10 extensions that are worth trying.</description><postDescription>

Even developers who use another main IDE probably use VS Code for some part of their jobs.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show some of the extensions that I use to work, study and write this blog.</description><postDescription>

In these situations, we have some options:
Clone again to another folder: This was the option that I used up until some time ago, but if you are working on a big code base, it may take some time to download the remote repository and it will use more space in the disk because you will end up with one copy of the repository for each branch;
Stash or commit changes and checkout the other branch: This is ok, but it takes more steps and doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for multiple branches checked out in parallel;
Add a new working tree: This is what I prefer to do because I can have only one local repository shared between the branches.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Git working trees to make those branch switches easier.</description><postDescription>
