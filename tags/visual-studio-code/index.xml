Even developers who use another main IDE probably use VS Code for some part of their jobs.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show some of the extensions that I use to work, study and write this blog.

In these situations, we have some options:
Clone again to another folder: This was the option that I used up until some time ago, but if you are working on a big code base, it may take some time to download the remote repository and it will use more space in the disk because you will end up with one copy of the repository for each branch;</description><postDescription>
