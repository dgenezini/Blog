The simple act of adding a new box may require us to drag all the existing boxes and reorganize the diagram. This is one of the main reasons to why software diagrams are constantly left deprecated after the first stages of the development process.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how defining diagrams as code can help in designing and updating software diagrams, and how to automate the process of updating the documentation with those diagrams.</description></item><item><title>Cleaner representation of software architectures with the C4 Model</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/cleaner-representation-of-software-architectures-with-the-c4-model/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 05:45:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/cleaner-representation-of-software-architectures-with-the-c4-model/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/cleaner-representation-of-software-architectures-with-the-c4-model/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Cleaner representation of software architectures with the C4 Model" />Introduction Diagrams are a great way to visually communicate something. However, the majority of software architecture diagrams don&amp;rsquo;t really express what they intend to, lacking description of its elements and with lots of implicit notations only understood by who drew the diagram. Also, they try to express more than one vision (high level, infrastructure, flow order, etc) in only one diagram, making it even harder for non technical people or people outside the project to understand.</description></item></channel></rss>
