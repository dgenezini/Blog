The problem is that, because some features are dependent of runtime implementations, C# versions are generally tied to .NET runtime versions. For example, C# 11 is enabled only in .NET 7 and above.

In the context of errors, null is a problem because the effects of not handling them right are perceived only at runtime.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use a C# language feature to move the null errors to compile time and help us avoid them at runtime.</description><postDescription>

It helps in finding bugs and requirements not fulfilled at development time, but also decreases the cost of maintenance by making the future changes to our code safer. Besides, the act of writing testable code alone increases the quality of the code we are writing because testable code has to be decoupled.
In this last post of this series, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to analyze and enforce a minimum code coverage in our applications, and how to use integration tests to increase our testing surface.</description><postDescription>

Also, it helps to enforce and validate if the code written is following a defined standard, for example, using PascalCase for class names and camelCase for parameter names.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Roslyn Analyzers with C# to enforce some standards of code quality and code style on your code, throwing errors at compile time if any rules are not being respected and not allowing the code to be pushed to protected branches of the repository.</description><postDescription>

For example:
Using tabs/spaces and different sizes of indentation, making your code harder to read; Using different encoding between files, causing hard to find bugs at runtime (showing invalid characters) and breaking automated tests. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to maintain a standard for everyone who works in the code, no matter the editor used, and in a next post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to enforce these (and other) rules on build and in the continuous integration pipeline.</description><postDescription>
