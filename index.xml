They can examine the code to find code smells, vulnerabilities, potential errors, and code out of a defined standard, for example. They work by parsing the source code and evaluating its syntax (structure of the code) and semantic (meaning of the code).
Roslyn, the C# compiler, provides tools for developing Roslyn Analyzers (Static code analyzers for Roslyn), giving access to the syntax and semantic of the code, that can be executed at development and build time, providing feedback in near real-time to the developers.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show a Roslyn Analyzer I built for using Discriminated Unions in C#, requiring to check the union type before access, and talk about some lessons learned while developing it.</description><postDescription>

With the release of .NET 7, Microsoft included a feature to render Blazor components in JavaScript applications (RegisterCustomElement&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;). This helps those who want to slowly migrate JavaScript applications to Blazor, but unfortunately, won&amp;rsquo;t work for exposing Blazor components as microfrontends, as it works only for JavaScript applications deployed together with the Blazor application.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll present a nuget package that I&amp;rsquo;ve created as a prototype to try to solve this problem, exposing Blazor components with module federation for other applications to consume.</postDescription></item><item><title>Analyzing and enforcing .NET code coverage with coverlet</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/analyzing-and-enforcing-.net-code-coverage-with-coverlet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 08:10:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/analyzing-and-enforcing-.net-code-coverage-with-coverlet/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/analyzing-and-enforcing-.net-code-coverage-with-coverlet/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Analyzing and enforcing .NET code coverage with coverlet" /> Automated software tests are a requirement for ensuring we are delivering a product with quality to our users. It helps in finding bugs and requirements not fulfilled at development time, but also decreases the cost of maintenance by making the future changes to our code safer. Besides, the act of writing testable code alone increases the quality of the code we are writing because testable code has to be decoupled.
In this last post of this series, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to analyze and enforce a minimum code coverage in our applications, and how to use integration tests to increase our testing surface.</description><postDescription>

Also, it helps to enforce and validate if the code written is following a defined standard, for example, using PascalCase for class names and camelCase for parameter names.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Roslyn Analyzers with C# to enforce some standards of code quality and code style on your code, throwing errors at compile time if any rules are not being respected and not allowing the code to be pushed to protected branches of the repository.</description><postDescription>

For example:
Using tabs/spaces and different sizes of indentation, making your code harder to read; Using different encoding between files, causing hard to find bugs at runtime (showing invalid characters) and breaking automated tests. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to maintain a standard for everyone who works in the code, no matter the editor used, and in a next post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to enforce these (and other) rules on build and in the continuous integration pipeline.</description><postDescription>

In these situations, we have some options:
Clone again to another folder: This was the option that I used up until some time ago, but if you are working on a big code base, it may take some time to download the remote repository and it will use more space in the disk because you will end up with one copy of the repository for each branch;
Stash or commit changes and checkout the other branch: This is ok, but it takes more steps and doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for multiple branches checked out in parallel;
Add a new working tree: This is what I prefer to do because I can have only one local repository shared between the branches.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Git working trees to make those branch switches easier.</description><postDescription>
