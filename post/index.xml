Also, it helps to enforce and validate if the code written is following a defined standard, for example, using PascalCase for class names and camelCase for parameter names.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Roslyn Analyzers with C# to enforce some standards of code quality and code style on your code, throwing errors at compile time if any rules are not being respected and not allowing the code to be pushed to protected branches of the repository.</description></item><item><title>Defining formatting rules in .NET with EditorConfig</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/defining-formatting-rules-in-.net-with-editorconfig/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 08:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/defining-formatting-rules-in-.net-with-editorconfig/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/defining-formatting-rules-in-.net-with-editorconfig/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Defining formatting rules in .NET with EditorConfig" />Introduction When working with other people and multiple editors/IDEs, it is common to have different editor settings, losing consistency in formatting styles of the code. For example:
Using tabs/spaces and different sizes of indentation, making your code harder to read; Using different encoding between files, causing hard to find bugs at runtime (showing invalid characters) and breaking automated tests. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to maintain a standard for everyone who works in the code, no matter the editor used, and in a next post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to enforce these (and other) rules on build and in the continuous integration pipeline.</description></item><item><title>VS Code extensions worth trying out</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/vs-code-extensions-worth-trying-out/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/vs-code-extensions-worth-trying-out/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/vs-code-extensions-worth-trying-out/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post VS Code extensions worth trying out" />Introduction Visual Studio Code is the most used IDE according to the Stack Overflow 2022&amp;rsquo;s Developer Survey and it has lots of extensions to help us be more productive. Even developers who use another main IDE probably use VS Code for some part of their jobs.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show some of the extensions that I use to work, study and write this blog.

In these situations, we have some options:
Clone again to another folder: This was the option that I used up until some time ago, but if you are working on a big code base, it may take some time to download the remote repository and it will use more space in the disk because you will end up with one copy of the repository for each branch;</description></item><item><title>Integration tests without API dependencies with ASP.NET Core and WireMock.Net</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 08:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Integration tests without API dependencies with ASP.NET Core and WireMock.Net" />Introduction Although there are many definitions about the scope of an integration test, Martin Fowler defines Narrow integration tests, where the integration with other systems are tested using mocks, and Broad integration tests, where they communicate using real APIs.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to create mocks for HTTP APIs in narrow integration tests using the WireMock.Net library.
What should we mock? Vladimir Khorikov has a concept of managed dependencies and unmanaged dependencies, which I consider complementary to Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s, to choose what should be to mocked.</description></item></channel></rss>
