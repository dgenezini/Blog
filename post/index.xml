It&amp;rsquo;s a really powerful system with lots of hidden features not known by most of us developers.

This will leave metrics and logs of a successful request when the client received a time-out error.

The simple act of adding a new box may require us to drag all the existing boxes and reorganize the diagram. This is one of the main reasons to why software diagrams are constantly left deprecated after the first stages of the development process.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how defining diagrams as code can help in designing and updating software diagrams, and how to automate the process of updating the documentation with those diagrams.</description><postDescription>

However, the majority of software architecture diagrams don&amp;rsquo;t really express what they intend to, lacking description of its elements and with lots of implicit notations only understood by who drew the diagram. Also, they try to express more than one vision (high level, infrastructure, flow order, etc) in only one diagram, making it even harder for non technical people or people outside the project to understand.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll present the C4 model and how it can produce software architecture diagrams that are inclusive to non-technical people, easier to understand and, consequently, better to document our software systems.</description><postDescription>

This helps those who want to slowly migrate JavaScript applications to Blazor, but unfortunately, won&amp;rsquo;t work for exposing Blazor components as microfrontends, as it works only for JavaScript applications deployed together with the Blazor application.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll present a nuget package that I&amp;rsquo;ve created as a prototype to try to solve this problem, exposing Blazor components with module federation for other applications to consume.</description><postDescription>

It helps in finding bugs and requirements not fulfilled at development time, but also decreases the cost of maintenance by making the future changes to our code safer. Besides, the act of writing testable code alone increases the quality of the code we are writing because testable code has to be decoupled.
In this last post of this series, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to analyze and enforce a minimum code coverage in our applications, and how to use integration tests to increase our testing surface.</description><postDescription>

Also, it helps to enforce and validate if the code written is following a defined standard, for example, using PascalCase for class names and camelCase for parameter names.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Roslyn Analyzers with C# to enforce some standards of code quality and code style on your code, throwing errors at compile time if any rules are not being respected and not allowing the code to be pushed to protected branches of the repository.</description><postDescription>

For example:
Using tabs/spaces and different sizes of indentation, making your code harder to read; Using different encoding between files, causing hard to find bugs at runtime (showing invalid characters) and breaking automated tests. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to maintain a standard for everyone who works in the code, no matter the editor used, and in a next post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to enforce these (and other) rules on build and in the continuous integration pipeline.</description><postDescription>

In these situations, we have some options:
Clone again to another folder: This was the option that I used up until some time ago, but if you are working on a big code base, it may take some time to download the remote repository and it will use more space in the disk because you will end up with one copy of the repository for each branch;
Stash or commit changes and checkout the other branch: This is ok, but it takes more steps and doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for multiple branches checked out in parallel;
Add a new working tree: This is what I prefer to do because I can have only one local repository shared between the branches.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Git working trees to make those branch switches easier.</description><postDescription>
