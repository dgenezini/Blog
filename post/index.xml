In these situations, we have some options:
Clone again to another folder: This was the option that I used up until some time ago, but if you are working on a big code base, it may take some time to download the remote repository and it will use more space in the disk because you will end up with one copy of the repository for each branch;</description></item><item><title>Integration tests without API dependencies with ASP.NET Core and WireMock.Net</title><link>https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 08:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.genezini.com/p/integration-tests-without-api-dependencies-with-asp.net-core-and-wiremock.net/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Integration tests without API dependencies with ASP.NET Core and WireMock.Net" />Introduction Although there are many definitions about the scope of an integration test, Martin Fowler defines Narrow integration tests, where the integration with other systems are tested using mocks, and Broad integration tests, where they communicate using real APIs.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to create mocks for HTTP APIs in narrow integration tests using the WireMock.Net library.
What should we mock? Vladimir Khorikov has a concept of managed dependencies and unmanaged dependencies, which I consider complementary to Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s, to choose what should be to mocked.</description></item></channel></rss>
